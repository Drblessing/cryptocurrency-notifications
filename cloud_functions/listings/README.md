# Exchange Listings

# Overview

[Cryptocurrency Alerting](https://cryptocurrencyalerting.com/guide/binance-coinbase-exchange-listings.html)

When a top crypto exchange lists a new coin or token, it can be a big deal. Exchange listings are seen as a huge endorsement by the community and give crypto projects a boost in credibility. Additionally, exchanges like Coinbase and Binance can greatly increase the market liquidity of an asset, giving larger institutional investors less hesitation to invest in a project.

Some exchanges (currently both Binance and Coinbase Pro) also provide additional data prior to when a coin is listed. This allows us to provide a listing announcement alert prior to the listing event itself. The time between the announcement and the listing can vary from under an hour to as much as several days.

Exchanges are always changing their processes. I will try to keep this updated as best as possible, but please let me know if you see any errors or omissions.
